# Driver-Fatigue-Detection

Various machine learning classification algorithms are tested to predict if a driver is fit to drive..<br>

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stayalert/data) has three groups of features-<br>
P1, P2 ,..., P8  -> physiological factors<br>
E1, E2 ,..., E11 -> environmental factors<br>
V1, V2 ,..., V9 -> vehicular factors<br>

Logisitic Regression, Naive Bayes and Random forests from scikit-learn are used for training...<br>
Maximum accuracy is obtained using Random Forests...
